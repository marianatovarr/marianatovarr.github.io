    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I will be returning to Ernst & Young (EY) in Houston as an Incoming Technology Consulting Intern in Summer 2026. 
      I was invited to return after a successful first internship in Summer 2025, where I served as a National Technology Launch Intern. 
      During that time, I supported an SAP transformation engagement, working with cross-functional teams to enhance client systems through data-driven solutions. 
      I helped refine AI forecasting tools and contributed to improving user experiences through personalized recommendations. 
      In my upcoming role, I look forward to expanding my expertise in SAP S/4HANA and supporting digital transformation initiatives.

      I currently serve as a Director for Sophomores Advancing in Leadership (SAIL), a program that empowers students to develop leadership potential through mentorship and engagement. 
      In this position, I help organize professional workshops, coordinate intramural events, and lead the annual spring fundraiser. 
      I am also a member of Delta Sigma Pi, where I work on the recruitment team to help plan networking and professional development events for business students. 
      Additionally, I am involved with the Texas A&M Consulting Group (TACG), collaborating on consulting projects that provide local businesses with strategic recommendations to improve operations and growth.
